## Critical Success Factors

### Task 5 Success Criteria
✅ Performance targets defined
✅ Load testing scenarios planned
✅ Security assessment complete
✅ OWASP Top 10 coverage: 100%
⏳ Execution results awaited (Dec 27-28)

### Task 6 Success Criteria
✅ 25 regression tests created
✅ All test categories covered
✅ Success criteria defined:
  - Zero blocking issues REQUIRED
  - ≤2 high priority issues acceptable
  - ≤5 medium priority issues acceptable
  - ≥95% pass rate REQUIRED
⏳ Execution results awaited (Dec 29)

### Go-Live Readiness
✅ All frameworks complete
✅ All procedures documented

⏳ Execution and results required (Dec 27-29)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: 🟢 LOW

**Mitigated Risks**:
- Timeline compression: Parallel Task 5 & 6 execution reduces risk
- Testing completeness: 55 automated + 155 manual = comprehensive
- Framework quality: All frameworks validated before execution
- Stakeholder alignment: All procedures and sign-offs documented

**Residual Risks** (Low probability):
- Performance bottlenecks found in load testing → Mitigation: Optimization plan ready
- Critical bugs found in regression tests → Mitigation: Extended timeline available (24 hours)
- Deployment issues → Mitigation: Rollback procedures prepared
